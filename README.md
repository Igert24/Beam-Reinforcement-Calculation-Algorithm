# Beam-Reinforcement-Calculation-Algorithm
This appendix presents the C# implementation of a reinforced concrete beam design algorithm for members under flexural load following Eurocode 1992-1-1. The code automates both Ultimate Limit State and Serviceability Limit State calculations, including crack width verification and deflection checks according to the Finnish National Annex.
